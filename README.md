# CloudFlare Worker Proxy for SourceForge

Slow speeds on sourceforge? Welcome to my proxy service, which is powered by cloudflare! Helps you download a huge file at maximum possible speed for your bandwidth.
It just proxies the download via CF, ensuring a better download.

Please attempt to host it yourself and use it, workers are free for a really large number of requests. You could save my request limit.
